# Identification-Of-Fake-Indian-Currency-Noes
The scope of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect counterfeit 
Indian currency notes in real time using Xception Architecture. The system will be 
trained on datasets of genuine and counterfeit 2000 and 500 rupee notes, and will 
achieve high accuracy in detecting forgeries. The system can be deployed in banks, 
ATMs, and other financial institutions to help combat the issue of counterfeit 
currency in India.
