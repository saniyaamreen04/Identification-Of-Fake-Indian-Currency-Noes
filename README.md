# Identification-Of-Fake-Indian-Currency-Noes
The scope of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect counterfeit 
Indian currency notes in real time using Xception Architecture. The system will be 
trained on datasets of genuine and counterfeit 2000 and 500 rupee notes, and will 
achieve high accuracy in detecting forgeries. The system can be deployed in banks, 
ATMs, and other financial institutions to help combat the issue of counterfeit 
currency in India.
Developing an efficient system to detect counterfeit currency notes is a critical 
requirement for financial security. Traditional approaches using hardware and image 
processing methods have limitations in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The 
objective of this project is to propose a novel approach to identify fake Indian 
currency using machine learning techniques such as Xception Architecture. The 
project aims to analyze the currency images of different denominations to identify 
features that can distinguish genuine notes from counterfeit ones. The system will be 
trained on large datasets of Indian currency notes, with a focus on the 2000 and 500 
rupee notes, to learn the features that are unique to each denomination. The goal is to 
achieve high accuracy in detecting fake notes in real-time scenarios, thus providing a 
secure mechanism for financial transactions. This project aims to provide a reliable, 
efficient, and cost-effective solution to detect counterfeit Indian currency notes, thus 
helping to maintain the integrity of the country's financial system.
